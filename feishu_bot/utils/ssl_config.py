SSL Certificate Configuration Module

This module provides SSL certificate configuration for secure HTTPS connections
to the Feishu API. It uses the certifi library to provide trusted CA certificates.

Requirements:
- Requirement 8.1: Set SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable to certifi certificate bundle path
- Requirement 8.2: Clear SSL_CERT_DIR environment variable
- Requirement 8.3: Use configured SSL certificates for all HTTPS requests

    Configure SSL certificates for HTTPS connections.
